Drag mod zip and ModMenu zip into Unity Mod Manager (or ModFinder).\n1. Run your game.\n1. Profit.\n\n# Features\n- Allows mount/dismount with a customizable keybind. \n    - Mount: **Ctrl+Shift+A** (default).\n    - Dismount: **Ctrl+Shift+D** (default).\n- Auto mount when entering area (toggleable).\n- Whitelist party members mounting by party slot position.\n\n# FAQ\n\nAsk and I shall answer.\n\n# Planned upgrades\n- Use party member names instead of party slot number.\n\n# Notes\n- You can make the mount/dismount toggleable by assigning the same keybind to both funcions.\n- Even though you can tecnically mount/dismount anywhere anytime (as long as the game allows it) it **will** consume your move action if you perform it while in combat.\n- On mounting riders will teleport to their respective mounts. I don't intend to implement any movement animation for the time being.\n\n\n",

    "Description": "# Champion-Feats\nStack the deck in your favour, if you want\n\nAdds a series of \"Champion\" feats that will stack the game in your favour, in exchange for paying a feat slot for them. Obviously not based in tabletop. Or any strong sense of game balance.\n\nSpecifically adds:\n\nChampion Protection - adds a +1/+2/+3 AC bonus depending on whether you're wearing light, medium, or heavy armour. Scales as you increase in character level, up to +24 AC when wearing Heavy Armour with a level 40 character.\n\nChampion Guard - adds a +5 DR/- bonus. Every 5th level increases it by another +5.\n\nChampion Aim - adds a +1 attack bonus to any weapon. Increases by +2 for every two levels starting at level 3.\n\nChampion Saves - adds +2 per level to all saving throws\n\nChampion Skills - adds a +1 bonus to all skill checks. Increases by +1 for every two levels starting at level 3. This can be toggled to add directly to skill ranks if desired, avoiding issues with untrained skill checks and checks against skill ranks that ignore bonuses.\n\nChampion Strikes - adds +1 damage to any weapon attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at level 4.\n\nChampion Spell Blasts - adds +1 damage to spell attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at caster level 4.\n\nChampion Spell Force - adds +1 to the DCs of your spells. Increases by +1 for every caster level.\n\nChampion Spell Penetration - adds half your caster level to the spell penetration stat of your spells. If you also take the basic Spell Penetration feat, this increases to a full caster level bonus.\n\nYou can adjust whether these should be considered normal feats or Mythic feats if you want to make it a bit harder for you in a playthrough you're using this mod in.\n\nAll Champion feat bonuses can be modified, to not only change the bonus provided but also how many level steps are required per bonus increase i.e. +1 every two levels or +5 every level.\n\n**How to install**\n\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0\n2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n3. Download the Champion Feats mod\n4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n\n**How to build** (updated)\nNow requires you first create an environment variable, called WrathInstallDir, containing the path to the base Wrath folder. All Wrath includes are now relative to that value.\n\n**Thanks**\n\nVek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. \n",

Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (min v0.23)\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Character Options+\n3.

They are not required but I developed the mod using them and there may bugs if you use it without them.\n\nIf you do not want to use ModFinder, download [CharacterOptionsPlus.*.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/releases/latest) and install it using Unity Mod Manager.

the Winter Patron spell list\n* Evasion is available as a Slayer Advanced Talent\n* Classes with Animal Companions get Share Spells\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n* Heavenly Fire can be used 3 + Charisma Modifier times per day instead of just 3\n* Lord Beyond the Grave buff can bet set to permanent, preventing lag / encumberance issues while walking around\n* Serpent's Fang poison DC is calculated correctly\n* Serpent Friend grants +3 to Perception instead of +2, matching the feature description\n\n## Reporting Problems\n\n### First, go to Settings > Mods > Character Options+ and turn on \"Enable Detailed Logs\"\n\n**Follow this guide: [So you want to report a WotR mod bug?](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/ModBugReports.md)** Ideally include a save file.\n\n1. Use [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) to install [Mewsifer Console](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole) and Mewsifer Console Menu\n2. Reproduce the issue in-game\n3. Open Settings > Mods > Mewsifer Console and select \"Mod Bug Report\"\n    * ![Mewsifer Console Menu screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/bug_report.png)\n4. File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) and attach the generated bug report\n5. Include your save file in the bug report\n    * Saves are stored in `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous\\Saved Games`\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* [Some buffs do not work with BubbleBuffs](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/76)\n    * Also AoE indicators are not enabled in BubbleTweaks by default\n* Winter Witch's Frozen Caress hex does not apply DC increases from things like Elemental Focus; this will probably never be fixed. It does apply the bonus from Winter Witch's Ice Magic.\n\n### Mod Options\n\n![Mod options screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/settings.png)\n\nThis mod uses [Mod Menu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu), settings are in the game settings: Settings > Mods > Character Options+. They are not available in UMM.\n\nAll settings changes require a restart to take effect.\n\nYou can use options to disable any feature added. This will:\n\n* Prevent the feature from being selectable\n* Remove any effect from the feature\n* Remove any changes to existing mechanics\n\nThis will not:\n\n* Remove the feature from characters (but it will not work)\n* Grant a replacement feature for characters who have it\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Bubbles (factsubio) for [BubblePrints](https://github.com/factubsio/BubblePrints), saving me from going mad.\n* Vek17 for [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core), so I don't have to distribute my transpilers.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n### Localization\n\n* Kurufinve - Russian\n* 呶呶BOT - Chinese\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat).\n",

    "Description": "# Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters\n\nMy continuation of [Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/40)\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download (**Install only one, not both**):  \n- ### Latest version. Requires [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases).  \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/latest)\n\n- ### Old version without ModMenu dependency   \nIn case you don't want to install ModMenu. Less functions, but deals with crusade the same.    \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/download/1.3.1/CombatRelief-1.3.1.zip)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Remove 1.2.1 version of Combat Relief if you have it.\n3. Install ModMenu.\n4. Install this mod.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- ### Autowin of crusade battles  \nCrusaders' armies always win autoresolve. Don't forget to enable crusade setting \"Run the tactical combat automatically\".\n\n- ### Avoid random encounters   \nMakes your party always avoid random encounters. Story encounters during travel are unaffected by the mod.\n\n- ### Prevent Corruption  \nWhen enabled corruption is not gained during rest.\n\n- ### Skill roll modification (version 2.1.0+)\nAllows to set on each skill if you want to roll normally/take 10/take 20.  \nCan be set to work out of combat only.\nDisabled by default.\n\n- ### Teleport to skeleton mechant button (version 2.2.0+)\nTeleports you to skeleton merchant random encounter area.\nHas a check for game being main campaign, but other than that will teleport out of any situation and act. Don't use it to get there when you're not supposed to.   \nSo to be safe use it only when you're on global map.\n\n## Settings\n\nAny and all functions can be disabled in Options -> Mods -> CombatRelief. (Or in UMM if you're on version 1.3.1)    \nBy default all functions are enabled.   \nSettings can be save-specific. Meaning if you change them in loaded game, that will affect only this save. If you change them while in Main Menu, that's sets default for all saves where they are not overwritten by save-specific settings.     \nSettings affect game immediately, no restart is required.\n\n## Credits\n\nBtB/streikeferret - original Combat Relief mod creator\n\nPermission from him:\n\n> Anyone who wants to continue this mod is free to reverse engineer my existing DLLs.",

    "Description": "# Enduring rework - mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nChanges Enduring spells and Greater Enduring Spells mythic abilities to be the following\n\nEnduring Spells\n```\nPrerequisite: Metamagic (Extend Spell)\n\nYou've learned a way to prolong the effects of your beneficial extended spells.\nBenefit: Effects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic applied that should last longer than an hour but shorter than 24 hours now last 24 hours. Effects that should last longer than 10 minutes (but no longer than 1 hour) last 1 hour. Effects that should last longer than 1 minute  (but no longer than 10 minutes) last 10 minutes.\n```\n\nGreater Enduring Spells\n```\nYou've mastered a way to prolong your beneficial spells.\nBenefit: In addition to existing benefits now effects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic that should last longer than an hour are permanent.\n```\n\n### Note:\n**Unlike base game where \"longer than X\" is \"longer or equal\" here it's actually longer as written.**\n\nSo 1 minute extended spell will stay 1 minute. 1 minute 12 seconds will become 10 minutes.\n\nCave Fangs, Call Lightning, Call Lightning Storm won't become permanent, at max 1 day. Sorry if you already theorized this.\n\nDoes not introduce save dependency, so you can remove it any time.\n\nIf used together with Tabletop-Reworks, disable TT-Reworks changes to Enduring Spells. \nI've set up my mod to load afterwards and unconditionally overwrite TTT changes, but it's better to be safe.\n\n### My subjective reasoning behind this change:\nES without GES is worthless. No one needs to make 1hour+ long spells last longer.   \nWhile it's possible to throw Mage Armor and Freedom Of Movement on everyone and then rest to recover spell slots but number of such spells is relatively low and it's anything but interesting gameplay (especially if done on prepared caster)\n\nSo ES needed something to make it stand by itself.\n\nGES meanwhile is where most of the benefit is. It immediately allows min/level spell to last a day and at CL25 it includes round/level spells.   \nMy personal problem with that however is that 2 Mythic Abilities is too high of a price to make minute/level spells last longer and 25 CL is too high of a price to extend round/level price. If you're not playing merged spellbook character (I never do) than 25 CL is a very late game thing, unless you do some minmaxing to push your CL.\n\nSo I pushed most of the duration extending benefit to ES and to counter balance it a bit, only spells with Extend are affected. \nNow there's tangible benefits in extending spells that have low duration, but they won't be there forever with you.\n\nGES pushes some long duration buffs into permanent buffs. We both know your Barkskin will not suddenly run out ever. So let it always be there and not waste any more time on that.\n\nPotentially with my changes you (player) can have a character that exists to just throw these buffs permanently and then never ever be present in a party, but I'm not going to try to introduce logic to remove buffs if original caster is not present. As far I'm concerned this is a cheese that's too hard to fix, so it stays.\n\nIs my overhaul of ES/GES makes it stronger? I think so. But as I never play with them, because I think they are weak, I think buff is what they need. Does it go into overpowered territory? I don't think so, our opinions can differ.",

    "Description": "[b]GreatRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Availability of unique magical weapons is largely restricted to either longswords or one of the weird exotic weapons like sai's which literally no one wants to use but the game is covered with. There are probably about 20 different named longswords in the game, to maybe 3-4 decent greatswords, arguably the most popular weapon for front-line martials in Pathfinder. And of course, the legendary Paladin weapon that plays a special role in the entire adventure...is also a longsword, because why make anyone want to actually use one of those 20 other ones?\n<br />\n<br />If you're like me you were profoundly disappointed when you discovered that the game would force you to choose between playing with the weapon you wanted to or having to pass the game's iconic sword to a companion. Especially since in the Adventure Path on which this is based, Radiance is actually supposed to transform into a Paladin's preferred weapon. This mod is my attempt to remedy that. [b]GreatRadiance[/b] changes all versions of Radiance into a greatsword, and gives all magical versions of it the Evil Outsider Bane enchantment for good measure, to make up for the inability to enchant weapons and the absence of the 'Oath of the Crusade' archetype.\n<br />\n<br />[i][b]DISCLAIMER: [/b]This mod is not made for installation with the Unity Mod Manager. [/i]Read the installation instructions very carefully. I am not a C# coder, therefore this mod was made utilizing Owlcat's Wrath Modification Template for Unity. Eventually this will be installable through the Steam workshop but until then there's no way around manual installation that I'm aware of.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation Instructions:\n<br />*[i]A thorough installation manual in pdf format with extensive screenshot clarification is now available in the 'Files'  section under 'Miscellaneous'.[/i]\n<br />1.[/b] Navigate to [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/ and create a new folder named 'Modifications'. \n<br />[b]2.[/b] Unzip the mod and place the 'GreatRadiance' folder and all its contents in there.\n<br />[b]3.[/b] Create a file named 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' and place it within [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/   [b]\n<br />[/b][b]*4. [/b]Open 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' in notepad and add the modification to it by inputting:\n<br />{\n<br />     \"EnabledModifications\": [\"GreatRadiance\"]    \n<br />}\n<br />[b]5.[/b] Obtain Radiance, either by playing until you find it or loading up a game in which you've already gotten it.\n<br />[b]6. [/b]Enjoy! \n<br />\n<br />*If you're running another Unity-developed Mod such as my BetterBackgrounds mod simultaneously, the syntax looks like this\n<br />{\n<br />      \"EnabledModifications\": [\"BetterBackgrounds\", \"GreatRadiance\"]\n<br />}\n<br />\n<br />[b]Alternate Versions:\n<br />[/b]There are numerous alternate versions of GreatRadiance available as an optional files which replace Radiance with weapons other than Greatsword. Installation is identical. It is [b]not[/b] possible to run multiple versions of this Mod at the same time. That said, it is simply a matter of swapping out the GreatRadiance folder in the Modifications folder to change between versions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bastard Sword[/b] - IllegitimateRadiance\n<br />[b]Dagger[/b] - StabbityRadiance\n<br />[b]*Double Axe[/b] - OrcRadiance\n<br />[b]Dueling Sword[/b] - AldoriRadiance\n<br />[b]Dwarven Waraxe[/b] - GimliRadiance\n<br />[b]Earthbreaker [/b]-[b] [/b]SmashRadiance\n<br />[b]Elven Curve Blade [/b]-[b] [/b]CurvedRadiance\n<br />[b]Estoc[/b] - MatadorRadiance\n<br />[b]Falcata [/b]- AerekostesRadiance\n<br />[b]Falchion [/b]- CritRadiance\n<br />[b]Fauchard[/b] - GuanRadiance\n<br />[b]Glaive [/b]-[b] [/b]PoeticRadiance\n<br />[b]Greataxe[/b] - BarbaricRadiance\n<br />[b]Handaxe[/b] - HatchetRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Flail [/b]-[b] [/b]AkkhanRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Mace[/b] - MolagRadiance\n<br />[b]Kukri [/b]- NokRadiance\n<br />[b]Longbow[/b] - HunterRadiance\n<br />[b]Longspear[/b] - KnightlyRadiance\n<br />[b]Quarterstaff [/b]- StickRadiance\n<br />[b]Rapier [/b]- PointyRadiance\n<br />[b]Scimitar[/b] - DrizztRadiance\n<br />[b]Scythe [/b]- LichRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortspear [/b]- SpartanRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortsword[/b] - LesserRadiance\n<br />[b]Staffsling [/b]- KenderRadiance\n<br />[b]Starknife[/b] - StarRadiance\n<br />[b]Throwing Axe[/b] - ChuckRadiance\n<br />[b]Trident[/b] - TritonRadiance\n<br />[b]*Two-bladed Sword[/b] - RoninRadiance\n<br />[b]Warhammer[/b] - ToragRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[b]*[/b]If you convert Radiance to a double weapon, then load up a saved game that already has Radiance and has it equipped on a character, it will break your inventory. You'll need to use Toybox to remove the item altogether, then re-add it and equip it properly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n<br />Q: [/b]Help! I've followed the instructions but nothing happened - Radiance is still a longsword.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Doublecheck the 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings' file you created. Ensuring that file extensions are turned on, is the full name with extensions 'OwlcatModificationManangerSettings.json.txt'? If so, eliminate the '.txt' and that should fix the problem. If it's still not working, hit me up in the comments or over DM and I'll help you troubleshoot.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]My game isn't starting.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]There is almost a 100% chance other mods are at fault here. The most common cause until recently was a conflict between AutoBuff and TableTopTweaks.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]What about Natural Attacks/Unarmed Strikes?\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Unfortunately this is something I just can't figure out how to do right now. I do genuinely want to bring the option to use Radiance to monks, Paladins of Irori, and the like but it's just not within my ability at the moment. Rest assured I *will* make this option if and when that changes.\n<br />\n<br />If you enjoy this mod, my other mods are available at the links below:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/205]Better Backgrounds[/url] - Revamps the existing backgrounds and adds new ones to ensure background selection is meaningful for all characters\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/134?tab=description]Chrom (Matt Mercer) Voice Pack[/url] - Adds the voice of Chrom from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/223]Lucina Voicepack[/url] - Adds the voice of Lucina from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice",

    "Description": "# Isekai Mod\nThis is a content mod for `Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous` that adds an `Isekai Protagonist` Class into the game.\n## Development Guide\n### Requirements\n- Visual Studio\n### Setup\n- Add `WrathPath` as an environment variable with the value `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` or wherever your game directory is.\n- Open Visual Studio and [publicize your assemblies](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Publicize-Assemblies).\n### Testing\n- Create a folder called `IsekaiMod` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure\\Mods`.\n- After building your solution in Visual Studio, go to your project directory -> `bin` -> `Release` or `Debug` -> `IsekaiMod` -> `net472`.\n- Copy the files and folders from the diagram below and place them in the `IsekaiMod` folder you created.\n- You'll need to create the `UserSettings` folder. Copy the `AddedContent.json` and the `Blueprints.json` files from the project and place them inside.\n```\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure\\Mods\\IsekaiMod\n\nIsekaiMod/\n├── Assets/\n│   └── ...\n├── Localization/\n│   └── LocalizationPack.json\n├── UserSettings/\n│   ├── AddedContent.json\n│   └── Blueprints.json\n├── Info.json\n├── IsekaiMod.dll\n└── ModKit.dll\n```\n- For the Assets make sure you have the Portraits. Copy them from a [Release](https://github.com/JohN100x1/WOTR_IsekaiMod/releases).\n- Now you can start your game and test.\n\nOn subsequent tests you'll only need to copy the `IsekaiMod.dll`.\n- If you edited the blueprint names, copy `Blueprints.json` as well.\n- If you added new assets, copy those as well.\n## Mod Information\n### Requirements\n- [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).\n- [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).\n### Installation\n- Open Unity Mod Manager and go to the 'Mods' tab.\n- Drag and Drop the [TabletopTweaks-Core.zip](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases)﻿ file into Unity Mod Manager.\n- Drag and Drop the [IsekaiMod.zip](https://github.com/JohN100x1/WOTR_IsekaiMod/releases) file into Unity Mod Manager.\nIf you use ModFinder rather than Unity Mod Manager just replace the name mentally in your head, instructions are otherwise identical.\n\n### Downward Compatibility Warning for version 4.0.0\nThe rogue abilities the protagonist, villain, and edge lord got and the paladin abilities the hero got were moved into progression features with plenty of additional options added (see below).\nThis means a rather heavy change in the classes progression trees for all four of those options, if you are updating with an existing savegame using something like [barleyFlours Respec Mod](https://github.com/BarleyFlour/RespecMod) is highly advisable.\nOtherwise you will miss out on things when leveling up.\nException to this is the God Emperor as all options that were changed were not part of its original definition so you are only missing out on some additional options for overwhelming abilities you could have picked at level one.\n\n\n### New Content\n- New Classes & Archetypes\n\t- `Isekai Protagonist`\n\t\t- Spontaneous caster that uses Charisma.\n\t\t- Has a really powerful spellbook that has spells from all other classes.\n\t\t- Has extra feats like the fighter but not limited to combat feats.\n\t\t- Starts of with the `Plot Armor` feature which make them hard to kill.\n\t\t- Has Overpowered Abilities.\n\t\t- Can merge their spellbook with angel or lich.\n\t\t- Can choose a familiar or animal companion... or a deathsnatcher.\n\t\t- Can choose a legacy class feature (features from other classes).\n\t- `God Emperor` (Isekai Protagonist Archetype)\n\t\t- Spontaneous caster that uses Wisdom.\n\t\t- Has powerful scaling immunities and auras.\n\t- `Edge Lord` (Isekai Protagonist Archetype)\n\t\t- Has alot of extra attacks.\n\t\t- Uses dexterity for damage and attack rolls.\n\t- `Hero` (Isekai Protagonist Archetype)\n\t\t- Focuses to protective auras for allies.\n\t\t- Uses charisma for damage and attack rolls.\n\t- `Mastermind` (Isekai Protagonist Archetype)\n\t\t- Intelligence based caster that memorizes spells like an arcanist.\n\t\t- Spellbook has 10th level spells.\n\t- `Overlord` (Isekai Protagonist Archetype)\n\t\t- Has much more Overpowered Abilities.\n- New Features\n\t- `Exceptional feats`: Strong feats that can be chosen in place of a feat/bonus feat.\n\t\t- `Mythic feat`: You can choose a mythic feat instead of a normal/bonus feat.\n\t\t- `Effect Immunity`: You become immune to a specific effect.

`TabletopTweaks-Base` mod, the Isekai Protagonist will have all extra metamagics as OP ability options.\n### MysticalMayhem (0.1.5)\nIf you have the `MysticalMayhem` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will have the 9th level `Meteor Swarm` spell added to its spellbook.\n### ExpandedContent (0.5.2)\nIf you have the `ExpandedContent` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will have all the new spells add to its spellbook. You also get to choose drake companions.\n### SpellbookMerge (1.7.1)\nIf you have the `SpellbookMerge` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will be able to merge its spellbook with Aeon, Azata, Demon, and Trickster.\n\n### Any Mod adding spells to the base classes\nAs of version 4.0.0 there is an option to create the Isekai spell list by merging most of the non mythic ingame spell lists. That means that as long as the mod loads in before this one and adds the spell to at least one of those lists the Isekai Protagonist gets it too.\nThe list of spell lists we merge for this is fairly comprehensive, Cleric, Wizard, Druid,all the base game domains, all the different wizard specialisation lists, Witch, ...\nAs such almost no spell should need work on our part to add support for it, if you find one please let us know.\n\n## Credits\nThanks to kjk001 for contributing alot to this repository, improving the code to use TabletopTweaks-Core as well as adding lots of content.\nThanks to WittleWolfie for creating this modding guide that helped me get started:\n- https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki\n",

    "Description": "﻿# Kineticist Elements Expanded\n\nMod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous\n\n\n## Credits and Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to [Truinto][1] author of [Dark Codex][2] for providing help, advice, and some methods so I could gain my own footing in C# and modding P:WoTR\n\nThanks to the entire OwlCat community discord and the modding community there, for answering my plethora of strange questions and pushing me in the right directions\n\nThank you to [Adsam112][3] for some custom icon images for the Void Element\nThank you to [RevanStarForge][4] for some color variations of those images. And for creating a whole bunch of new images for Void, Wood, and Aether!\nThank you Kerrovitarr (Discord) and [q892398745][5] for creating localizations in Russian and Chinese\n\n## Description\n\nThis mod adds expanded element choices for the Kineticist class. Currently this mod adds only the \"Aether\" element from the Tabletop version of Pathfinder.\nMore elements may be coming in the future.\n\nAdded elements means: More blast types, More infusions, wild talents, Elemental Defense, etc.\n\nThis mod originally started as a personal project to add my favorite element, Aether, to the game. But I have expanded the scope to encompass any other elements others might want to add to the game.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for elements to add to the game, please reach out to me, write an issue for the repo, etc.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nI also do not have the skills currently to add custom effects to the game, so any element added will borrow the effect from other kineticist elements.\nI shall try to match the theme/element of the ability as best as possible to make it visually appealing\n\n## Help Requested\n\nThere are a lot of spell effects in game, and I've added a lot of spells, spell-likes, and special abilities that I cannot add all of the required FX or icons myself\n\nIf you come across any icons or FX (projectiles/AoE/etc) that you think might fit one of these abilities, please let me know and I'll get them added soon\nThank you!!\n\n## Content\n\n| Element | Feature | Description | Status |\n| :------ | :------ | :---------: | ------ |\n| Aether | Element Choice | The main aether element, adds selections for base kineticist (and archetypes) and kinetic knight | Done |\n| Aether | Basic Blast and Composite | Telekinetic and Force Blast -

I went over the codebase (10K+ lines) 3 times to align each element to work as similarly as possible\n- Fixes should be a lot easier in the future\n- Now using CodexLib (From DarkCodex) so everything should stay up-to-date and work great\n\n- Fix: Force Throw works again\n- Break: Many Throw does not work\n- Break: Void: Vampiric Infusion not working?\n- Break: Some infusions are just missing? (Greater Toxic/One of the Admixtures)\n\n\n- Now updated for the most recent game version (Thing should just work again<sup>tm</sup>)\n\n### v2.5.2\n\n- Fix Negative Energy Kinetic Blade Text\n- Fix Void Healer prereq for Vampiric Infusion\n- Change icon reference for Positive Admixture to an icon that actually exists\n- Fix Summer/Winter blades correctly targeting normal AC\n- Actually compiled in release mode this time!\n\n### v2.6.0\n\n- Fix a mistake where Aether kineticists were being given the class skills of a Chaokineticist (Void)\n- Fix an issue where everyone was getting Aether Class skills, except it was actually void class skills\n- Buffed Wood Soldiers (They're supposed to have the \"Advanced Template\")\n- Noticed an issue with Skilled Kineticist and Kinetic Knights\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Maybe some Wood Issues\nI did have a problem loading my Wood testing save, so reach out if there are any issues loading your Wood Kineticists out there\n\n### Disintigration Infusion\nThis is a very strange infusion, both doubling damage, and halving it. For whatever reason, it does not work with the Spindle infusion, still working on that\n\n### Admixtures\nThese work pretty well in all cases, I have only seen a single issue: When using either of the energy admixtures, and you crit, the damage modified by the admixture will not deal double damage, but the original damage type will.\nWhen using DarkCodex, admixtures are not added. I believe this is due to DarkCodex, and it is in Truinto's to-do backlog to make sure they are added\n\n### Wood Soldiers\nIt is possible, if you use the ability after one or two dies, to have up to 7 wood soldiers, still trying to figure out how to limit the amount of summons\nUsing the ability at 4 or more Soldiers causes you to take burn, but does not summon soldiers (Max 4, but the ability shouldnt go off)\n\n### Whirlwind and Blades\nBlades have a few issues, and whirlwind not working with modded blades is one of them. Reach out if you find more please\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/Truinto\n[2]: https://github.com/Truinto/DarkCodex\n[3]: https://github.com/Adsam112\n[4]: https://github.com/RevanStarforge\n[5]: https://github.com/q892398745\n",

(See How to try it section)\n\n## IMPORTANT: By itself this mod does NOT change any in game builds. Until you add them yourself, the only effect will be avilability of automatic level up regardless on setting.\n\nClarification on last point: this is done by bypassing the check of game setting entirely. So even if 'Off' is selected, auto level can happen until you take control of levelling process.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Get pregen of MC or feature list of companion. Two options for that:\n\t- Write (or get someone else to write) level up plan for some character (either companion or your pregen) in specified format.\tPut it into `FeatureLists/` (for companions and other units) or `Pregens/` (for MC) folder inside mod install folder.\n\t- Load some save, open UMM mod menu and press export. This will output files directly into needed folder.\n2. It will be applied to characters that you haven't met yet. Meaning that pregen for MC can only be defined before starting the game.\n3. Just play.\n4. If at any point you want to remove the mod, you're free to do so. All existing characters will keep what they already picked and if your normal difficulty setting allows auto level, they will progress on plan that were defined for them.\n\n## What it can do\n- Replace existing in game pregens.\n- Replace companion level plans entirely. Meaning feat selections can be defined from lvl 1. But not stats (or race, or gender, or alignment). Once again reminder - this will only apply if you haven't met that companion yet.   \n- Edit feature selections of other in game units if for some reason you want to.\n\n## What it CAN't do\n- Change already met companions\n- Change companions stats, race, gender, alignment.\n- Change your level up plan if you're already following one\n- Pre-set pregen visual characteristics to your liking. You'll get default race/class look, that you can change during character creation.\n- Make builds that have normal progression depend on mythic progression (second bloodline feats or mythic feat extra mythic feat being a prerequisite for) (Will be solved in the future)\n\n## What can export do\n- It knows which classes you took and in which order\n- It tries to calculate level when you took feature selections.\n- It tries to guess what stat you raised on level ups. Mostly it assumes you put point into your highest stat\n- It takes all skills you put levels into and just throws them all. If your skill strategy is more complicated then max same skills, you will have to adjust output yourself\n- Game does not know which spell you learned when, so it throws all your known spells on each spellcaster level. Adjust spells learned yourself.\n\n## How to try it \n\n1. Load one of your saves.\n2. Export your MC overwriting one of the standard pregens.\n3. (Optional) Close the game and go open pregen in Pregens folder (file should be named after your character) and adjust skills taken and spells learned.\n4. Start new game with it.\n5. Toybox yourself to 20\n6. Enjoy clicking next while seeing levels go by. Hopefully :)\n\n\n## How to write feature list or pregen.  \nTake a look at [How to.md](/How%20to.md), I try to describe how it works, but it still requires a bit of technical knowledge and you will probably need additional tools.   \nLook at provided samples. Seelah alternative build is an easy example (just lvl20 paladin). Pregen is a Monk(SF)1/Sorc4/DD4/Ek10/Sorc1 gish, and it shows how multiclassed builds work. Note - neither of two builds are recommended, they're just samples.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\nIf level up plan stops for no reason that can be because of several reasons\n\nPossibility: Your character on that level depended on something gained from outside source. Game tries to evaluate plan entirely right when it first loads the character and if it forecasts that you for example won't be able to take this feat, it does not record this action for future use.  \nSolution: Don't do such builds for the moment, until I find a safe way to fix this. Alternatively enable ToyBox option that allows taking any feat without prerequisites and choose pregen with it enabled. Disable when you get control of your character.\n\nPossibility: something-something that I haven't encountered. \nSolution: try temporarily disabling experimental patches and reloading the game. If that doesn't help you will have to continue manually. If you want to help me troubleshoot please prepare pregen that you loaded and save file. (Or better yet if you have archive manager, open save with it since it's just a zip file and extract party.json out of it - that's the only file of interest).\n\n\nIf something during manual leveling process seems to go wrong, try disabling \"experimental\" patches and restarting the game.  \n",

Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n4. (Optional) Search for and install Mewsifer Console Menu and its dependency, [ModMenu]()\n    * Adds a button to the Mods menu which generates a bug report containing all logs from the current game session\n    * This is a great way to get bug reports from users\n\n![Menu options screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/menu.png)\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/releases) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation run `%WrathPath%/Mods/MewsiferConsole.Mod/MewsiferConsole.exe` where `%WrathPath%` is the base game directory, `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` by default for Steam users.\n\nYou will be prompted to select a log source:\n\n![Startup screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/startup.png)\n\nSelect \"Connect to game\" to view logs for a currently active game instance. You can also start the game after starting the console.\n\nSelect \"Load from file\" to load a `*.mew` file created using the bug report API.

For example, if your filter was `ch:Mews ch:Tabletop -sev:E -sev:V`:\n\n| Log Event                                       | Shown? | Why?                |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | :----: | ------------------- |\n| (I) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Connected             | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (E) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] An exception occurred | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (V) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Sending message       | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Core] Adding                | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Rework] Adding              | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [System] Await                              | No     | No matching channel |\n\n### Log Level / Severity\n\nFor UMM logs:\n\n| Logging Method             | Severity  |\n| -------------------------- | :-------: |\n| `ModLogger.Log()`          | (I)nfo    |\n| `ModLogger.Warning()`      | (W)arning |\n| `ModLogger.Error()`        | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.Critical()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.LogException()` | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.NativeLog()`    | (V)erbose |\n\nFor Game logs:\n\n| Logging Method           | Severity  |\n| ------------------------ | :-------: |\n| `LogChannel.Log()`       | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Verbose()`   | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Warning()`   | (W)arning |\n| `LogChannel.Error()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `LogChannel.Exception()` | (E)rror   |\n\nNotably, Game logs do not support `Verbose`, so calls to `LogChannel.Verbose()` use the same severity as `LogChannel.Log()`.\n\n### Bug Report API\n\nIf you want to capture bug reports for your mod you can call `Mewsifer.GenerateReport(fileName)` ([Source](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/MewsiferConsole.Mod/Mewsifer.cs)):\n\n1.

Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n4. (Optional) Search for and install Mewsifer Console Menu and its dependency, [ModMenu]()\n    * Adds a button to the Mods menu which generates a bug report containing all logs from the current game session\n    * This is a great way to get bug reports from users\n\n![Menu options screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/menu.png)\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/releases) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation run `%WrathPath%/Mods/MewsiferConsole.Mod/MewsiferConsole.exe` where `%WrathPath%` is the base game directory, `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` by default for Steam users.\n\nYou will be prompted to select a log source:\n\n![Startup screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/startup.png)\n\nSelect \"Connect to game\" to view logs for a currently active game instance. You can also start the game after starting the console.\n\nSelect \"Load from file\" to load a `*.mew` file created using the bug report API. See below for instructions on creating a bug report.\n\n**Important:** The console relies on a mod to send log events.

    "Description": "# Miscellaneous Tweaks and Fixes for WotR\n\nA small collection of fixes or tweaks to things that bugged me while playing.\nRequires [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases)\n\nAll features can be enabled or disabled in the Mods menu.\n\n### Natural Attack Stacking\n\nPreviously, if you got multiple natural attacks of the same type from different features/buffs/etc.\nyou would get extra attacks per round. This was 'fixed' by Owlcat at some point so now extra natural \nattacks give no benefit to PCs. With this enabled, vanilla behaviour is replaced with an approximation\nof the tabletop rules:\n\nAddtional natural attacks of the same kind gives a stacking increase to the effective size of the 'weapon'\n(eg. 2 pairs of Medium claw attacks effectively grant 1 pair of Large claw attacks instead).\n\nYou get all 'enchantment' effects (elemental damage/DR penetration/etc.) but multiple enchants of the same type\ndo not stack.\n\n### Major Strength Blessing Armor Speed Fix\n\nWarpriest's Major Blessing for Strength domain now applies to heavy armor in addition to medium\narmor - now matches its description.\n\n### Force Book of Dreams Upgrade\n\nThe Book of Dreams item is supposed to upgrade at certain points in the story,\nbut this has never reliably worked (at least in my experience). Enabling this forces the \nupgrade script to run on every Etude update. Disabled by default.\n\n### Reformed Fiend DR/good\n\nChanges the damage reduction for the Reformed Fiend Bloodrage archetype from DR/evil to DR/good.\nDisabled by default.\n\n### Dollroom postprocessing filter toggles\n\nAllows you to disable some postprocess filters in the dollroom (inventory screen, character creation. mythic level up, etc.)\n\n## Now includes fix for the \"Kingmaker.Localization.SharedStringAsset must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new SharedStringAsset.\" log spam\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Special thanks to the modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) - in particular, Pheonix99 and Bubbles.\n* WittleWolfie for ModMenu\n",

    "Description": "# ModMenu\n\nAdds a new page to the game options for mods. This allows mods to easily implement settings using native UI instead of UMM. This does not create a save dependency.\n\n![Test settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/test_settings.png)\n\n![More settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/more_settings.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases/latest) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/issues/new) or reach out to me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) in #mod-dev-technical or #mod-user-general channel.\n\n### Controller Support\n\n**This does not support controllers**. It's a lot of work to support, but let me know if you need this. If there is enough demand I will add it.\n\n## Mods Using ModMenu\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list, let me know if you want your mod added here!\n\n* [Added Feats](https://github.com/Telyl/AddedFeats)\n* [BOAT BOAT BOAT](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_BOAT_BOAT_BOAT)\n* [Character Options+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus)\n* [MewsiferConsole](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole)\n\n## Mod Developers\n\n### Why should you use it?\n\n* It looks nice!\n* Automatically persists your settings\n* Handles restoring defaults\n* Automatically persists per-save settings\n* Super easy to use\n\n### How to use it\n\nThe screenshot above was generated using [TestSettings](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs). That exercises every function supported. The API is documented and generally self-explanatory.\n\nIn your mod's `Info.json` add `ModMenu` as a requirement:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu\"]\n```\n\nYou should specify a minimum version:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu-1.1.0\"]\n```\n\nIt's safest to just specify the version you build against as the minimum version, but methods added after 1.0 do specify the version in their remarks.\n\nInstall ModMenu then in your mod's project add `%WrathPath%/Mods/ModMenu/ModMenu.dll` as an assembly reference.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nCreate a setting:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.AddSettings(\n  SettingsBuilder.New(\"mymod-settings, SettingsTitle)\n    .AddToggle(Toggle.New(\"mymod-settings-toggle\", defaultValue: true, MyToggleTitle)\n      .OnValueChanged(OnToggle)));\n      \nprivate static void OnToggle(bool toggleValue) {\n  // The user just changed the toggle, toggleValue is the new setting.\n  // If you need to react to it changing then you can do that here.\n  // If you don't need to do something whenever the value changes, you can skip OnValueChanged()\n}\n```\n\nGet the setting value:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.GetSettingValue<bool>(\"mymod-settings-toggle\");\n```\n\n**The game handles the setting value for you.** You do not need to save the setting, or set the setting to a specific value. You *can* set it if necessary but most of the time it isn't necessary. This includes saving settings that you flag as per-save using `DependsOnSave()`.\n\nFor more examples see [TestSettings](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs).\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* **Do not add settings during mod load,** without additional handling you cannot create a `LocalizedString`. I recommend adding settings before, during, or after `BlueprintsCache.Init()`.\n* Don't use `IsModificationAllowed` to enable/disable a setting based on another setting. This is checked when the page is opened so it won't apply immediately.\n* Indicate settings which require reboot using `WithLongDescription()`. The game's setting boolean `RequireReboot` does nothing.\n\nDefine a \"root\" key unique to your mod to make sure there are no key conflicts:\n\n```C#\nprivate const string RootKey = \"mymod-settings\";\n```\n\nYou can then prepend this to all of your settings keys:\n\n```C#\n\n// Results in a settings key \"mymod-settings-key\"\nvar toggle = Toggle.New(GetKey(\"toggle\"), MyToggleTitle);\n\nprivate static string GetKey(string key)\n{\n  return $\"{RootKey}-{key}\";\n}\n```\n\nJust make sure you always get the key the same way when getting a setting value.\n\n### Settings Behavior\n\n* Settings with `DependsOnSave()` are associated with a save slot, but do not create save dependencies\n    * You do not need to handle saving or restoring settings at all, though save dependent settings may be lost if the mod is disabled\n* `OnValueChanged()` is called after the user clicks \"Apply\" and confirms\n* `OnTempValueChanged()` is called immediately after the user changes the value, but before it is applied\n* A setting's value can be checked at any time by calling [GetSettingValue()](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/ModMenu.cs#L85)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* A shout out to Bubbles (factsubio) who essentially wrote the new image and button settings types when I was about to give up.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

    "Description": "[b]Summary[/b]\n<br />\n<br />A simple mod to show possible items from the very first relic project card. No more wasting time on relic projects hoping you will get some useful item in the end, now you can see all options from the very beginning! \n<br />\n<br />Also has an option to disable automatic pop-ups of completed projects in kingdom management (disabled by default, can be enabled from the UMM mod menu,  default ctrl+F10). This was added to address a bug in 1.1 beta, which prevented the game from progressing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important notice: [/b]This mod sometimes disables relic card texts after a game patch, and it needs to be built against the new binaries each time. If you already have the Toy Box mod, this mod was integrated into it some time ago, and that mod is probably getting more regular updates than I can provide; so I recommend enabling relic information from there if you are already using it. Still, I will try to post updates to this mod when I can.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Updates[/b]\n<br />[b]0.2.2[/b]\n<br />- Patch compatibility with 1.3.0k.\n<br />[b] 0.2.1[/b]\n<br />- Patch compatibility with 1.1.0k - relic cards were missing their text when opened.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Install the latest version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/]Unity Mod Manager[/url] (UMM), and set it up for Pathfinder: WotR[b].[/b]\n<br />[*]Manually download the mod archive (.zip), and install it through UMM. You can simply drag &amp; drop the archive to the box in UMM.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />You are set! The game should show the installed mods at the main menu.\n<br />\n<br />Note that using mods disables Steam achievements. You can re-enable them with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/119]this mod[/url]﻿ (at least at the time of writing this).\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />Other Information[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The mod does not change any files, so it should be compatible with most other mods and should not mess with your save games. That being said, use it at your own risk.\n<br />\n<br />Although I try my best to avoid bugs, and the changes are quite simple, they might still exist... All bug reports and constructive feedback are welcome!\n<br />\n<br />Source files are in the files section.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Kudos[/b]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/users/943197]TheLich[/url] for providing an updated version of the mod while I was away.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/users/37868990]SirMadjesty[/url] for checking compatibility with one of the patches.",

Very powerful with the right domains for a casting-focused cleric.|Yes|\n|Pact Wizard|Archetype|Haunted Heroes Handbook version. A wizard who trades bonus feats for a witch patron, an oracle curse and other goodies.|No|\n|Razmiran Priest|Archetype|Not the prestige class but the sorcerer archetype. Loses a few bloodline spells and one bloodline power in exchange for infinite scrolls and wands as long as you have enough spells per day to cover them.<br>Slightly nerfed from their tabletop equivalent as their abilities only work with spells on the cleric list instead of all divine spells. Still very overpowered but you have to live with the shame of worshipping a level 19 wizard who has to beg Tar-Baphon to leave him alone.|No|\n|Warsighted|Archetype|A more fighter-y oracle archetype who loses revelations in favor of fighter bonus feats.|No|\n|Acadamae Graduate|Feat|Cast full-round summoning spells as standard actions but with a Fortitude save to avoid being fatigued.|No|\n|Earth Magic|Feat|+1 CL when on your favorite terrain.|No|\n|Purity of Sin|Feat|Thassilonian Specialist only. +2 CL for the school of magic associated with the sin.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|Yes|\n|School Expertise|Feat|Arcane school powers can be used 3 additional times. Can be taken multiple times.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|Yes|\n|Staff-like Wand|Feat|Calculate wands CL and DC with the wizard's caster level and stats.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|No|\n|Circle of Order|Magus Arcana|Adds half the magus level to AC against Chaotic enemies for 1 round.|No|\n|Malice|Magus Arcana (Hexcrafter only)|Originally designed by Rite Publishing.<br>The hexcrafter's attacks deal an additional 2d6 unholy damage to targets under the effect of their hexes.|Yes|\n|Abundant Spell Synthesis|Mythic Ability|Spell Synthesis can be used one extra time per 3 mythic ranks. This ability can't be taken before rank 3 so it's basically 3 extra uses at rank 9.|Yes|\n|Material Freedom|Mythic Ability|Can ignore a specific material spell component (Diamond, Jade, etc...).|Yes|\n|Purity of Sin (Mythic)|Mythic Feat|Purity of Sin also grants +2 bonus to DC.|Yes|\n|Spell Synthesis|Class Feature|Add the Mystic Theurge's capstone.|No|\n|Manifestations|Class Feature|Add the capstones to Shaman spirits. They have been adapted to the game the same way Owlcat adapted the final revelations for Oracle mysteries (they're virtually identical).|No|\n|Meteor Swarm|Spell|Add the level 9 Evocation spell Meteor Swarm.<br>It's quite simplified from its TT version because having to pick 4 targets every time you cast it would be annoying. It now simply deals 28d6 fire damage in an area (to counterbalance the fact the save penalty after the touch attack doesn't exist anymore). Might need a balance pass.|No|\n|Baldur's Gate Stoneskin|Spell|**Disabled by default!**<br>Change Stoneskin to be closer to its [Baldur's Gate incarnation](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Stoneskin).|Yes|\n|Sure Casting|Spell|Add the level 1 Divination spell [Sure Casting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sure-casting/).|No|\n|Bloody Tears and Jagged Smile|Spell|Add the level 2 Necromancy spell [Bloody Tears and Jagged Smile](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bloody-tears-and-jagged-smile/).|No|\n|Draconic Malice|Spell|Add the level 3 Enchantment spell [Draconic Malice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/draconic-malice).|No|\n|Mighty Strength|Spell|Add the level 4 Transmutation spell [Mighty Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mighty-strength/).|No|\n|Spell Turning|Spell|Add the level 7 Abjuration spell [Spell Turning](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spell-turning).<br>The resonating field behavior of the spell is not implemented, mostly because I find it a poor fit for a video game. Instead, the spell behaves like its Baldur's Gate counterpart: if Spell Turning absorbs a spell of higher level than it has left then the spell is not reflected, it simply fizzles. Other than that, it works exactly like tabletop.|No|\n\nSettings\n-----------\nBecause this mod uses Mod Menu, settings are in the game settings: Settings > Mods > Mystical Mayhem.\n\nFAQ & Troubleshooting\n-----------\n**Q:** Something doesn't work!\n<br>**A:** Create an [issue](https://github.com/kreaddy/MysticalMayhem/issues) and describe **what** doesn't work and how I could reproduce it, if possible. You can also ping me in the #mod-user-general channel of the [Owlcat discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) (kreaddy#3461).\n\n**Q:** What about Magic Time?\n<br>**A:** Magic Time was the first mod I ever made for a Unity game so I felt the need to rebuild it from the ground up.\n\n**Q:** No Blood Arcanist or metamagic?\n<br>**A:** Most of my old metamagic feats and arcane discoveries have been remade in [Tabletop Tweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base). Likewise, Blood Arcanist and Mythic Poison are now in [Homebrew Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/279).\n\n**Q:** Can you add X?\n<br>**A:** Maybe. Make a feature request and I'll add it if I feel like it. No promises though.\n\n**Q:** Your naming sense sucks.\n<br>**A:** I'm just a fan of Ogre Battle and Might & Magic ;_;\n\nCredits\n-----------\n* [Kifusou](https://github.com/Kifusou) and [nixgnot](https://github.com/nixgnot) for translating the mod into Chinese.\n* bubbles for [BubblePrints](https://github.com/factubsio/BubblePrints) and for being generally very helpful.\n* Vek17 for [Tabletop Tweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core), which has been very useful to learn when I started modding.\n* WittleWolfie for releasing Mod Menu, finally freeing us from the horror of ImGui.\n* The mod community on the [Owlcat discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat).\n",

    "Description": "# Mythic Path Power Swapper mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nAllows changing mythic powers to powers from another path, or playing without mythic powers at all.\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download:  \n\nFirst get [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) if you don't have it\n\nNow download this mod: [**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/MythicPathPowerSwapper/releases/latest)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Install ModMenu.\n3. Install this mod.\n4. Set settings to your liking.\n5. Restart to apply them.\n## Functionality\n\nDoes NOT introduce save dependency, so safe to remove mid-game. Just do respec and things should mostly (see notes below) return to normal.\nAffects ALL saves globally.\n\n**SETTING CHANGES APPLY ONLY AFTER RESTART**\n\nHow to use: \nChoose which mythic path to change.\nChoose how to change.\n\n\nLegendarify option remove mythic powers and spellbook, grants rising bonus to all stats and modifies XP table so you get levels earlier. See section later.\n\nOption \"remove path powers\" makes your progression like your companions. \"Remove all powers\" removes everything. You still has mythic rank, but no abilities.\n\nSo for example if you pick Demon in first selection and Lich in second, your Demon will have Lich powers and Lich spellbook.\n\nNote on \"Add Aivu\":  \nThis adds Aivu to the selected mythic path (regardless of what you're copying from). I don't know what that will do. You wil have her, but will she talk, get recognized, break quests or your whole game - no clue. It's just a setting that took me 20 minutes to add, so I did because I can. If you try it, feel free to tell me how things went for you.\n\nOptions to demythic mythic hero and companions can be enabled without changes to your path powers.\n\n## Notes\n- Affects ALL saves. Because it does not create new blueprints (for save safety ) it changes existing. As unfortunate side effect of this if you set for example Lich have Aeon powers, that changes some Aeon powers to rely on Lich Mythic class, meaning some Aeon powers will not work correctly when you're an Aeon until you reset the power swap or remove the mod.\n- Affects things that are defined in mythic class progression. If you see it on mythic page - it's will be affected.   \n- You will get spellbook from the class that you copy from.    \n- You will receive Artifact Cloak of your original path, but enchantment will be swapped to the copied path.   \n- Story will proceed as your original path, there will be no recognition of \"wrong\" powers.    \n- If you're on Azata path you get Aivu as normal, because she's important to the story.   \n- If you copy from Azata, you by default do not gain Aivu, unless you toggle \"Add Aivu\" to On.\n\n- Azata receives spells depending on sub-path. So if you copy from Azata you don't get them. My advice - use TTT-Reworks, it adds those spells anyway.\n\n- Late game paths are unchanged. If you swap to Devil with changed progression I have no idea what will happen. Probably nothing, but it's on you.\nChanging to other late game paths that remove your old path abilities should work as usual.\n\n## Legendarify\n- Removes mythic powers\n- On ranks 3-5-7-9 you get stacking +1 bonus to all stats (total +4 to all stats at MR9)\n- With each mythic rank XP table gets shorter and shorter. At M3-M4 you can expect to be 1-2 levels higher than normal, at M5-M6 3-5 levels higher. At M9 progression is almost like normal legend, but to get to level 40 you need more experience than normal Legend. But you still will get lvl 40 eventually, just somewhat later. For comparison normal legend lvl 40 = legendarified lvl 38.\n- If you swap to late game non-Legend path, you get to keep your levels over 20. As far as I'm concerned this is your responsibility.\n- Exact XP table is at the bottom of readme.\n- You also get hidden legend feature that removes path visual changes.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nUnless you enabled \"Add Aivu\", turning mod off and doing respec will solve all your problems.\nIf you used \"Add Aivu\" maybe respec will help. Maybe not.\n\n## Compatibility with mods\nMaybe?   \nDepends on what and how they do things. \nIs mostly compatible with TTT at least, that I checked.\nI've tried to set priorities so it loads also after Path of Rage and Spellbook Merge, so maybe their changes are forwarded.\n\n\n## More spellbook merge? \nNO.  \nNot touching it.\n\n## Can I have multiple paths?  \nOut of scope for this mod.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### XP Tables\n\nNormal is normal XP table   \nLegend is Legend XP table   \nM3 - M9 is how your table changes over the course of mythic ranks.  \n\n| Level | Normal | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | Legend |   \n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |   \n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n| 2 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000\n| 3 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000\n| 4 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000\n| 5 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000\n| 6 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000\n| 7 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000\n| 8 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000\n| 9 | 75000 | 69000 | 67000 | 66000 | 64000 | 62000 | 61000 | 59000 | 55000\n| 10 | 105000 | 94000 | 89000 | 85000 | 80000 | 77000 | 73000 | 69000 | 62000\n| 11 | 155000 | 125000 | 120000 | 110000 | 100000 | 94000 | 87000 | 81000 | 68000\n| 12 | 220000 | 170000 | 155000 | 140000 | 125000 | 115000 | 105000 | 94000 | 75000\n| 13 | 315000 | 235000 | 205000 | 180000 | 160000 | 140000 | 125000 | 110000 | 85000\n| 14 | 445000 | 315000 | 270000 | 235000 | 200000 | 170000 | 150000 | 125000 | 96000\n| 15 | 635000 | 430000 | 360000 | 300000 | 250000 | 210000 | 175000 | 150000 | 105000\n| 16 | 890000 | 580000 | 475000 | 385000 | 315000 | 260000 | 210000 | 170000 | 115000\n| 17 | 1300000 | 785000 | 625000 | 500000 | 395000 | 315000 | 250000 | 200000 | 130000\n| 18 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 830000 | 645000 | 500000 | 390000 | 300000 | 235000 | 155000\n| 19 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 1100000 | 830000 | 625000 | 475000 | 360000 | 270000 | 180000\n| 20 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1450000 | 1050000 | 790000 | 580000 | 430000 | 315000 | 200000\n| 21 |  | 2650000 | 1900000 | 1400000 | 990000 | 710000 | 515000 | 370000 | 220000\n| 22 |  | 3600000 | 2550000 | 1750000 | 1250000 | 875000 | 610000 | 430000 | 260000\n| 23 |  | 4900000 | 3350000 | 2300000 | 1550000 | 1050000 | 730000 | 500000 | 280000\n| 24 |  | 6600000 | 4400000 | 2950000 | 1950000 | 1300000 | 875000 | 580000 | 315000\n| 25 |  | 8950000 | 5850000 | 3800000 | 2450000 | 1600000 | 1050000 | 680000 | 370000\n| 26 |  | 12000000 | 7700000 | 4900000 | 3100000 | 1950000 | 1250000 | 790000 | 445000\n| 27 |  | 16500000 | 10000000 | 6300000 | 3900000 | 2400000 | 1500000 | 920000 | 500000\n| 28 |  | 22500000 | 13500000 | 8100000 | 4900000 | 2950000 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 635000\n| 29 |  | 30500000 | 18000000 | 10500000 | 6150000 | 3600000 | 2100000 | 1250000 | 720000\n| 30 |  | 41000000 | 23500000 | 13500000 | 7700000 | 4400000 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 890000\n| 31 |  | 55500000 | 31000000 | 17500000 | 9700000 | 5400000 | 3000000 | 1700000 | 1000000\n| 32 |  | 75500000 | 41000000 | 22500000 | 12000000 | 6650000 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1300000\n| 33 |  | 100000000 | 54000000 | 29000000 | 15500000 | 8100000 | 4300000 | 2300000 | 1550000\n| 34 |  | 140000000 | 71500000 | 37000000 | 19000000 | 9950000 | 5150000 | 2650000 | 1800000\n| 35 |  | 190000000 | 94500000 | 48000000 | 24000000 | 12000000 | 6150000 | 3100000 | 2000000\n| 36 |  | 255000000 | 125000000 | 61500000 | 30500000 | 15000000 | 7350000 | 3600000 | 2550000\n| 37 |  | 345000000 | 165000000 | 79500000 | 38000000 | 18500000 | 8750000 | 4200000 | 3000000\n| 38 |  | 465000000 | 220000000 | 100000000 | 48000000 | 22500000 | 10500000 | 4900000 | 3600000\n| 39 |  | 635000000 | 290000000 | 130000000 | 60000000 | 27500000 | 12500000 | 5700000 | 4050000\n| 40 |  | 860000000 | 380000000 | 170000000 | 75500000 | 33500000 | 15000000 | 6650000 | 4700000\n",

Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n```\n## Changes\n```\n* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.\n* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.\n* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling.\n* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC.\n* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.\n* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.\n* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.\n* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.\n* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.\n* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.\n* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Lilithu, gaining a bonus to your Charisma as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Oolioddroo, gaining a bonus to your Dexterity and allowing all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* Fixes Demonic Aura so that it will only apply its damage when an enemy starts a new round instead of every time you activate Bloodrage.\n* Fixes autometamagic so that it will work on spells that are not originally part of a spellbook but added later. This is important for Arcane Bloodline for Bloodragers.\n* Adds a new mythic ability called Mighty Demonrage. This allows you to cast a demon spell of fourth level or lower as a swift action while Demon Raging.\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Oolioddroo major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge. This is because it conflicts with Abyssal Bulk from Bloodragers, and it's not tabletop compliant.\n* Added compatibility with TTT-Base and the Brimorak Aspect Fix. If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage. This only affects the new Demon Rage.\n* Demon Rage now updated. You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat. This also means it will not turn off when combat ends, meaning you get to stay angry even between cutscenes!\n* Elemental Rampager is now activated when you start your demonic rage.\n* Balor Aspect should no longer give its intelligence bonus.\n* Fixed bug with demon rage that causes it to persist when given as part of a cutscene.\n```\n## Current New Abilities\n![alt text](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_PATH_OF_RAGE/blob/master/PathOfRageDemonologies.png?raw=true)\n## Change Log\n```\n03/26/2023\n* Allows Demonic Charge to target a point instead of a unit.\n03/15/2023\n* Hotfix for Demon Rend and non-shapeshifted polymorph spells.\n03/14/2023\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage.

You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat.

If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Made the new demon rage no longer work with Dark Codex's infinite rage resource.\n03/21/2022\n* Carnage Incarnate's vulnerability removed\n* Carnage Incarnate's debuff will now deal 1d6 damage whenever attacked with a weapon.\n* Carnage Incarnate's explosion radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n* DEMONIC SMASH's radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n03/11/2022\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Quasit major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge.

This is because Enduring Spells no longer works on abilities.\n* Aspect of Lilithu has been added. This gives you a Charisma bonus as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* Aspect of Quasit has been added. This gives you a Dexterity bonus and allows all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* BlueprintCore has been stripped down to the bare essentials to what this mod needs to hopefully make it easier to survive updates in the future.\n01/09/2022\n* Fixed text on Demon Rage to correctly state that it starts at 12 rounds instead of 18\n* Demon Blast correctly is now given at rank 4 instead of rank 3\n11/25/2021\n* Fixed Demon Rage so that it no longer stays if triggered in a cutscene\n* Updated Unleashed Demon so that you may polymorph into a Sin Guzzler at Rank 9 at will for 24 hours.\n\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\nThanks to @Vek17#1898, @bubbles#0538, @kadyn#6364, @WittleWolfie#8477, and everyone else on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/owlcat).

    "Description": "# Random Enemies & Loot\n\nUpdate on 31.12.2021: Save game crash issues fixed. Random loot had issues spawning nulls which ended up crashing game. Ended up moving to use parts of random equipment by Hambeard. \n\nUpdate on 16.12.2021: Hopefully fixed all the issues with saves corrupting. Loot logic changed, took performance hit but no idea how to implement it on load area without issues with saves.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS IS VERY EARLY VERSION - it is highly likely that it will cause issue of replacing some important NPC! Toybox can most likely fix that. \n\n\n\nWhat does this mod do? Basically when a monster spawns, this mod will replace it with new one of similar kind of power level (in some cases you might roll a really hard fight). Every zone will have a theme and a backup theme chosen when loading into area from which the monsters pool is fetched first. If no match is found, then all pools are to be used. \n\nAlso all monsters have a chance to drop a random loot. Loot level is based on the CR of enemy with a roll for multipliers. \n\nThe mod has blacklisted the tutorial areas (and couple other). Also some mobs are blacklisted, but i have only played upto ~ending of act2 atm so i do not know for sure what happens in later acts with the mod on. \n\nI actually have three different models for this and this seemed most stable (other ones were replacing unit groups / units with new units, but i couldnt figure out how to have them spawn in realistic places).\n\nYou can contact me on Discord Pathfinder channel with name Ode\n\n**How to install**\n\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0\n2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n3. Download the mod\n4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n\n**Thanks**\n\nHambeard for creating Random equipment mod. This uses part of it for random loots. \n\nVek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. \nBubbles and rest of the discord <3\n",

Uninstalling might break your save.\n* I do not take any responsibility for broken saves or any other damage. Use this software at your own risk.\n* Please DON'T REPORT BUGS you encounter to Owlcat Games while mods are active.\n* BE AWARE that all mods are WIP and may fail.\n\nInstallation\n-----------\n* You will need [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).\n* Follow the installation procedure (tl;dr; select game, select folder, press install).\n* Download a release or rebuild your own [https://github.com/Truinto/SpellPouch/releases](https://github.com/Truinto/SpellPouch/releases).\n* Switch to the mod tab and drop the zip file into the manager.\n* If you have DarkCodex installed, only use version 1.3.0 or higher.\n\nContact\n-----------\n@Fumihiko me on the Owlcat Pathfinder discord: [https://discord.com/invite/wotr](https://discord.com/invite/wotr)\n\nAbility Groups\n-----------\nAbility Groups let you bundle abilities and activatables into a single foldable actionbar slot. They have a black border. \\\n![example group](/resources/example-group.jpg) \\\nThere are already some predefined groups for class features that are related to each other or use the same resource (like bard songs).\nYou can place the group on your action bar or open the folding view to place the abilities on your action bar directly. \\\nThe groups are defined in this file: \"Mods/SpellPouch/DefGroups.json\"\n\nEach group has these properties:\n- Title: Name of the group; must be unique\n- Description: Text displayed in the group's body; can be empty/null\n- Icon: Icon to use for this group; if icon is null, it will display the first active activatable or, if non are active, the first ability's icon\n- Guids: a identifier list of all abilities/activatables that are related to that group; if a guid is used in multiple groups, only the first group will apply\n\nYou may edit this file and reload the groups with the button in the mod's menu. There is also a button to unlock the groups.\nThis will display all groups for all characters, even if they have no matching abilities. To add/remove abilities with drag&drop mechanic, hold SHIFT will doing so.\nSimply hold shift and drag any ability on the group's icon to add it. \\\n![add ability](/resources/adding-ability.jpg) \\\nUnfold a group, hold shift and drag an ability from it onto the map to remove it again. \\\n![remove ability](/resources/remove-ability.jpg) \\\nHold shift and drag an ability onto another ability to create a new group. You will be prompted to give a new unique title name. \\\n![creating group](/resources/creating-group.jpg) \\\nTo delete a group altogether, hold shift and drag the group onto the map. This will also prompt a confirmation. \\\n![delete group](/resources/delete-group.jpg) \\\nYou can re-order groups by holding shift and draging an ability either on the left or right side of an existing ability. \\\nPlacing it left, will move it to the left of the target ability. \\\n![move left](/resources/move-left.jpg) \\\nPlacing it right, will move it to the right of the target ability. \\\n![move right](/resources/move-right.jpg) \\\nChanges will affect all party members equally. Remember to disable 'Unlock Groups' again, otherwise you might edit them unintentionally.\n\nSpell Groups\n-----------\nYou can also create Spell Groups. They have a grey border. \\\n![example spell group](/resources/spell-group.jpg) \\\nSpell Groups behave a lot like Ability Groups. But they are unique for each character. \nYou can add any spell you like, as long as it can be cast. Variant spells cannot be added. Pick one of the variants instead. \\\nTo cast a spell, unfold it and click on any spell. Or you may click the group itself to cast the first available spell. \\\nYou may also use auto cast. It will automatically advance to the next spell, when you run out of spell slots.\n\nBuilding\n-----------\nIf you want to compile this project, you will need to download the DarkCodex repository as well.\n\nFAQ\n-----------\nQ: Why is the placement random? \\\nA: It's not. It will place it left or right of the target ability base on which side is closer. Unfortunately there isn't a visual indicator, so if you are not aware, it will appear random.\n\n\n",

    "Description": "﻿# Spellbook Merge\n\nThis is a mod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous. It adds additional spellbook merging options.\n\n## Patch 1.3\n\nOwlcat introduced several changes to the Spellbook Merging system in patch 1.3, that just broke the mod.\nTo quickly fix the issue I have just undid the spellbook merging changes they introduced and used the old system.\nSo people that like Owlcat's new system, you will have to wait for a while for me to figure the new system out and patch it.\nFor people that liked the older merging system, think of this as a feature instead of a bug :)\n\n## Warnings\n\n* This mod creates new blueprints and thus creates a save dependency. Once your save depends on this mod, it is not safe to uninstall it.\n\n* To be careful, install this mod just before reaching Mythic Rank 3. Test that you get the option to merge spellbooks, if not file a bug report.\n\n* I have tested this mod only with Aeon-Inquisitor, the other merges are untested (for now).\n\n* After merging spellbooks your mythic spell progression is tied to your base spellbook. So be careful when taking dips, if you don't progress your base spellbook enough, you might end up not getting the required slots to cast higher level mythic spells.\n\n* Currently for Casters that learn spells automatically (Druid, Paladin etc.), there is a bug where any new spell slots gained by merging spellbooks do not trigger learning new spells. Reload the save/game to fix the issue. I haven't tested if you can recover them if use respec and keep progressing without learning these spells.\n\n* There is an incompatibility with Tabletop Tweaks where it modifies the BloodRager spellbook. So if you want to merge BloodRager with mythic paths, disable the specific TTT tweak for it.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe patches to spellbook progressions can be disabled in the json settings file.\nIn your mod directory for this mod, you should find a UserSettings directory. Open PatchSettings.json and set any spellbook progression patch that you do not want to false.\nNote that this only disables the spellbook progression patches, you will still get options to merge spellbooks, you can just chose not to merge if you don't want to.\n\n## Mythic Paths\n\n### Angel\n\nAngel can merge with the followin additional spellbooks\n* Palading (This needs thorough testing to see if higher level spells are castable and if the progressions are applied correctly. Be warned.)\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Witch\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Crossblooded Sorcerer\n\n### Lich\n\nLich can now merge with the following spellbooks.\n\n* Druid\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n\n### Aeon\n\nAeon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n\n* WarPriest\n* Inquisitor\n* Druid\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Hunter\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Azata\nAzata gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Magus\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Druid\n* Hunter\n* BloodRager\n* Wizard\n* ExploiterWizard\n* Arcanist\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Arcanist\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Demon\nDemon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* BloodRager\n* Hunter\n* Skald\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Bard\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Arcanist\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Witch\n\n### Trickster\nTrickster gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Alchemist\n* Eldritch Scoundrel\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Witch\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Cleric\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n\n\n## Base Spellbooks\n\nThe following spellbooks have had their spell slot progressions patched to allow access to higher level spells from mythic paths.\n\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Alchemist\n* BloodRager\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Inquisitor\n* WarPriest\n* Paladin\n* Hunter (Uses the Bard spellbook)\n* Eldritch Scion (Uses the Bard progression)\n\n\nThe patched hybrid casters mentioned above can cast 7th level spells post CL 20.\n\nPaladin progression has been specifically patched for allowing Angel merge. It has not been tested well yet. The progression is tight and slower than an Angel Oracle, but can't be helped, with the current approach. But by my estimation if you stay pure Paladin, you should be able to cast level 10 Angel spells as a merged caster once you reach Mythic 9/10.\nFile an issue report if that's not the case.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to give my sincerest thanks to:\n\n1. Owlcat for this amazing game.\n2. My fellow modders from discord for inspiration and answering my questions. Particularly Narria Cabarius, Vek17, Bubbles and ArcaneTrixter.",

The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell’s descriptor.\n    * Encouraging Spell (Metamagic)\n\t\t* Any morale bonus granted by an encouraging spell is increased by 1.\n    * Flaring Spell (Metamagic)\n        * The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell.

A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor.\n    * Intensified Spell (Metamagic)\n        * An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels.

    "Description": "﻿# Toggleable Throwing Weapons\n\nYou can now use a toggle to turn daggers and starknives into ranged weapons.\n\n## Implementation details\nI overrode the BlueprintItemWeapon getter in ItemEntity and ItemEntity<BlueprintItem>. I don't believe this should interfere with anything thanks to the sea of sanity checks but cannot confirm for certain.\n\n## Cross-mod compatibility\nWorks with Hambeard's Thrown Daggers mod and automatically incorperates the daggers from that (as of release 1.0). However, the RangedDaggers and RangedStars settings must be changed from their default true to false for my mod to work! There should be no conflicts with other mods but daggers from elsewhere will not be supported automatically. If/when there is a need for it I'll rig up some way to read the guids out of a supplemental JSON.\n\n## Known Quirks\nThe item names don't change by mode. I'll get to this later.\n\n\n# Credits\nThanks to Truinto for the AddFactOnlyParty code.\n\n# Changelog\n\n1.2.4: Works with the 2.1\n\n1.2.3: Hopefully fixed graphical jank for the last time\n\n1.2.2: Fixed Rogue Finesse training working with thrown weapons. Turned out to be incredibly imba\n\n\n1.2.1: Fixed interaction with Way Of The Shooting Star, should fix interaction with other attack /dmg stat replacers in general. Mod thrown weapon STR damage effect no longer force-sets stat dmg multiplier to 100%\n\n1.2: Point Blank Master (and any other ranged-only paramaterized features added by mods) now apply to thrown daggers/starknives. Increased range to 30 feet. \n\n1.1: Fixed dex to melee damage cutting out, fixed some graphical jank\n",

Is literally just Chain Lightning but dealing fire damage.\n\nFire Shield: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard/ Sun Domain, Level 5 Fire Domain. Pick between Warm and Cold shield. Warm shield cuts incoming cold damage in half, reduces to none on successful save, and retaliates with fire damage when hit in melee. Cold Shield works the same but protecting from fire and retaliating with cold.\nExisting domain picks were not removed - Sun 4 / Fire 5 have two picks. 1 round per level.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later, if I can figure out how\n\nVitrolic Mist: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard: Fire Sheild, only the protection and backlash are both acid.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later.\n\nEntropic Shield: Cleric 1 self-buff. Incoming ranged attacks have 20% miss chance, non-illusion. 1 minute per level.\n\nFreezing Sphere: Wizard/Magus 6 evocation. 1d6/level cold damage to a spherical area, increased damage to water subtype.\n\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cap is 20d6 instead of 15d6 to make vaguely relevant at the same level as chain lightning/chains of fire (effectively have selective baked in), Hellfire Ray (massively more damage and defenses against it are rarer) and Cold Ice Strike (natively quickened). Available in both tabletop 40ft blast and fireball standard 20ft blast - again, to make relevant when other on-level spells have much better form factor than nuking almost everything you can see.\n\nGloomblind bolts: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Witch/Wizard necromancy. Scorching ray, only dealing negative energy damage and blinding if the target doesn't save. \n\nChanges From Tabletop: Was Conjuration (creation)[shadow] on TT but that makes about zero kinds of sense so I changed it to necromancy.\n\nHeal Mount: Level 3 Paladin. Is literally heal but you can only cast it on your animal companion. At last something to do with Paladin level 3 spell slots!\n\nKeen Edge: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Inquistor/Wizard. Gives a weapon Keen for 10 minutes per level.\n\nSpear Of Purity: Level 2 Cleric / Angel: Range touch attack, deals 1d8 per 2 levels (max 5d8) to target - half to neutral, none to good, unless target is evil outsider in which case 1d6 per level (max 10d6). Half damage on will save. Evil targets are blinded on save fail.\n\nTelekinetic Strikes: Level 2 Magus/Wizard buff: Target ally deals 1d4 extra force damage on natural weapon hits, 1 minute per level\n\n### Feats:\n---\nAbility Focus- Breath Weapon: Adds +2 DC to breath weapons. Requires a breath weapon to take (or mixblooded bloodrager). This prereq uses significant hardcoding to detect polymorphs granting breath attacks and hasn't been fully tested.\n\nBurn Resistance: Treat your level as two lower for determining nonlethal damage from burn\n\nDiscordant Song: Bardsong adds 1d6 sonic damage to ally weapon attacks. For ranged attacks, targets must also be in the area of effect.\n\nExtra Burn: Increases daily burn limit by two points\n\nExtended Buffer: Increases internal buffer size by one\n\nProdigious TWF: Use strength rather than dex for TWF prereqs, no penalty for large offhand weapon.\n\nSundering Strike: On critical hit, attempt Sunder maneuver.\n\n### Paladin Mercies:\n---\nInjured: Grants fast healing for 1 round per 2 paladin levels.\n\nEnsorcelled: Attempts Dispel Magic on lay on hands - does not ever dispel buffs on friendlies.\n(Arguable) Changes from Tabletop: Unlike other mercies this effect makes sense when used offensively so it works when used on enemies - it dispels buffs there.\n\n### Items:\n---\nBracers Of The Merciful Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase a paladin's effective level for Lay On Hands power and uses by four. \n\nBracers Of The Avenging Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase the wearer's effective level when using Smite abilities by four.\n\n### Mythic Abilities:\nMythic Kinetic Aegis: Treat Kineticist Elemental Defense as having had 1 burn invested for free, one more at MR 3/6/9.\n\n## Bugfixes\n---\n### Items\n---\nRadiance +6 (uncorrupted) now gets Holy like it should\n\n### Classes\nArcanist: Holy Water Jet no longer requires Azata/Angel mythic class\n\nCavalier: Made Order abilities actually show up in the UI. \n\nMade Order Of The Stars's Calling Channeling support ability work. \nChanges from Tabletop: Works on anything with a Channel Positive / Channel Negative keyword set, which means it will work on Warpriest and Oracle and Necromancer channels. No idea if it works on Warpriest fervor used normally.\n\nKineticist: Now has the Internal Buffer feature - reduce accepted burn by one a limited number of times per day\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifier: Gets back level 3 revelation - TT purifier has forced unique pick, said ability is not implemented and probably not implementable so giving the pick back.\n\n### Bloodlines\n\nBlooderager Phoenix Bloodline is in.\nTabletop Tweaks Base is required.\n\n### Wild Talents:\n\nElemental Defenses and Aerial Evasion now use the main burn cost system - this is *not* disableable\n\nFlame Shield correctly halves incoming frost damage\n\n### Other\n---\nFixed extra hits: Fixed some (not all) cases where an effect that should add extra damage to an attack added extra hits instead. Currently: Firebrand, Claws Of A Sacred Beast, and the chibi dragon from Dawn Of Dragons\nONLY USE ONE OF TABLETOP TWEAKS's FIX AND MINE! The game won't load if you have both active!\n\nNote: Custom Implementation used on Claws of a Sacred Beast to preserve DR peirce properties from weapon attack isn't getting the damage type completely right - is doing all phys types instead of just slashing. \n\n## Tweaks\n---\nLittle things that aren't new content but aren't bug fixes either:\n### Spells\n---\nDispels are now buff/debuff safe - dispel magic series and slayer Dispelling Attack don't dispel buffs on user's allies or debuffs on their enemies. \n\n### Reward Feature Conversion\n---\nDawn Of Dragons gave you a perma Holy Aura effect for one resolution but this was implemented as a perma-buff meaning it wouldn't persist on respec and might be losable other ways. I turned this into a feature - see modified content for more.\n\n### Crusade\n---\nMovanic Devas now use greatswords properly\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifers now get Cure Light / Cure Moderate automatically - the archetype takes till level five to not be Oracle But Worse In Literally Every Way otherwise.\n\nPurifier Celestial Armor now works exactly like Armor Training of a fighter with 4 less fighter levels - including Advanced Armor Training. This hard-requires Tabletop Tweaks Base and will not activate if it can't detect that.\n\nStigmatized Witch gets Patron selection back - I consider switching from prepared to spontaneous a side-grade at best, with Witch's weak spell list downgrading patron to curse at the same time was just a nerfing. Comes with options to select Ember's patron. Disabled by default.\n\n### Bloodline Powers\nUnlimited Sorcerer Bloodline Claws: Removes use limit on abyssal/draconic bloodline claws. \nCombine Sorcerer Dragon Claws: Unifies all sorc bloodline claw abilities into one - if you have multiple bloodlines you get the lvl 11 energy damage for every last one.\n\n## Content Modifications\n---\nNot-so-little changes I've made to base game things. These all default to off.\nThese have nothing to do with the tabletop game - my changes to Owlcat Original Content.\n\n### Dawn Of Dragons Custom Reward\n---\nThe reward for picking the good option in this quest is almost insultingly bad. A vendor trash item and a perma-buff of a spell you almost certainly already have on most paths and that Angel gets a strictly better version of automatically.\n\nThis annoyed me so I changed it.\n\nIf you enable the Custom Reward, instead of giving you a perma holy aura buff the silver dragon gives you what's more or less perma-sorta-geniekind with this setting enabled. 1d6 cold on attacks (not an extra hit just damage, it's like having Elder Frost on everything) and +5 natural armor enhancement. Overall weaker effect but one that's much less likely to overlapped. Can set to be Angel only or for all paths with settings.\n\n### Crusade Events\n---\nMade rewards from Monster Slayers and Local Production crusade events permanent if options are selected because it makes more sense.\n\n\n##Coming Soon:\n\nOver\n\nInternal Buffer will be more elegant.\n\nBloodline Mutations (Havoc first)\n\nEarth Tremor spell\n\nMountain Witch Patron\n\nBanishing Warden Paladin Archetype\n\nTwin Metamagic Rods\n\nKinetic Lancer Kineticist Archetype\n\nBasic Elemental Kinesis Utility Talents\n\nFlumefire Rage feat\n\n\n",

Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)\n2. Download the [Mod](https://github.com/BarleyFlour/VisualAdjustments2/releases/latest/download/VisualAdjustments2.zip)\n3. Do either 3B or 3C.\n\n* 3B Extract the archive and put the mod folder into 'Mods' folder of the Game (\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure\\Mods)\n\n* 3C Drag the Downloaded Zip into Unity Mod Manager.\n\n5. Run the game and load your save\n6. Open the interface by opening your inventory and clicking on \"Visual\" in the top right corner.\n\n## Features\nCustom eye pictures.\nJust place a .png in the custom portrait folder named \"Eye.png\" and it will appear as the eye image (though you may have to reload a save/transition into a new area for it to update if you just switched portrait).

    "Description": "# WIT\n Pathfinder: WotR Inventory Tweak\n\n\nThis is the alpha release of Quick Cast (formally known as Inventory Tweaks in Kingmaker).\nthis mod is Save Game safe, install/uninstall will not break your saves.\nthis is an alpha release, expect there to be bugs.  The amount of abilities and spells one can have seems to be a lot higher than kingmaker.  This alpha release is to help me test the mod from start to endgame for bugs and performance issues.\n\nHow to use:\n* Install the mod using Unity Mod Manager\n* The first time the mod is ran the UI might be in an odd location.\n* All four edges of the window can be clicked and dragged to move the window where you would like it.\n* The bottom corner jewel can be clicked and dragged to scale the window to your liking as well.\n* These settings will be remembered going forward.\n* The upper left jewel can be clicked to minimize the UI window.  Click the box it minimizes to to restore the window.  The minimized box can be moved with click dragging as well. z button is the hotkey for this.\n* The upper right jewel will expand / contract all the items in the current view port\n* The lower left jewel will be for settings, this area has not been implemented yet.\n* The lower right jewel will scale the window by click dragging.\n* There are 6 viewports, Spells, Scrolls, Potions, Wands, Special, Favorite\n  * Spells shows you the current characters available spells. As you use the spells they will be removed from the list.  If there are no available spells then the view port will say so. The first number within the circle is the DC for the spell, the second is how many more times you can cast the spell for the day.\n  * Scrolls, Potions, Wands shows any of these items that are in the inventory.  Clicking on them will use the item.  Items will always be used by the current character. The first number within the circle is how many of the item you have stacked in your inventory.  Any unstacked items, such as partially used wands will be shown in a separate entry. The second number is the amount of charges remaining.  Potions and scroll always have 1 charge.  A note on belt slots.  The mod uses belt slot 5 to handle the items being used.  If you have anything in belt slot 5 it will be removed back to your inventory.  After using a wand if there are charges remaining it will stay in belt slot 5 till something else is used or the charges are exhausted.\n  * Special shows abilities the current character has, including Activatable Abilities.  Under the abilities tab, it will show usable abilities.  You may see items listed here if you have those items in a belt slot.  This is normal behavior due to how the belt slots work in game. The first number within the circle is again the DC when using this ability. The second number is how many uses are left on the ability.  Under the Activatable abilities tab, it will show abilities that can toggled or activated, such as Fighting Defensively.  The first circle will have an X in it if it active. The second square will have how many more times the ability can be activated for the day.\n  * Favorites is not implemented yet, but it will hold any spell, item, ability that you deem to have in one place making these commonly used entries even easier.\n* To use any entry simply click on it and it will automatically use the item if the target is self, or it'll bring up the target selector UI if the entry can be used on others.\n* To Hide/Show a list of entries under the purple header, click on the purple header and it will either expand or collapse all of the entries.  Remembering the status of these headers is planned for a future release.  As of now the status will be reset each new scene that the player visits.\n\n### Known issues (I will try to keep this as current as possible):\n* A few minor graphical glitches that will be ironed out as I go.\n\n### FOR BUGS USE THE ISSUE TRACKER, DO NOT USE THE ISSUE TRACKER TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS!\n### SUGGESTIONS CAN BE MADE VIA DISCORD #mod-user-general (@MENTION hambeard#1046)\n### DO NOT DM ME WITH SUGGESTIONS.\n### ANYONE NOT ADHERING TO THOSE SIMPLE RULES WILL BE IGNORED OR REPORTED FOR REPEAT SEVERE ABUSERS.\n",

It needs to be in the class/archetype progression to work alone.\nIf there is a feature that grants the actual resource-granting feature as with Alchemist Bombs, put the guid of that intermediate feature into WrapperGuid\n\nIt doesn't currently matter if you use ClassResourceFeatureGuids or NonClassResourceFeatureGuids.\nIt will eventually - put class feature from leveling in ClassResourceFeatureGuids and anything else that grants a resource like the Rogue Ki Pool Talent into NonClassResourceFeatureGuids\n\nFeatures that increase existing resources or alter costs should be handled automagically by my code, you don't need to do anything with them.\n\n##Uninstalling:\nJust remove it.\n\nIt doesn't add any blueprints or make any state changes, just redirects things.\n",
